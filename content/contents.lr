Hi! I'm Eric, and I've just defended my [doctoral thesis](http://ericmjl.github.io/thesis) in the [Department of Biological Engineering](https://be.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) on 27 April 2017! I am currently an [Insight Health Data Sciences Fellow](http://insighthealthdata.com/), and I'm thrilled to be a part of this growing data science community!

My life's motto is quoted from the Gospel of Luke: _"... From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked." - [Luke 12:48](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/LUK.12.48)_

I'd love to [connect with you](http://www.shortwhale.com/ericmjl). Other ways to connect are linked at the bottom of the page as well.
