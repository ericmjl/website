Hi! I'm Eric,
and I lead Research Data Science in the Data Science and AI group at [Moderna Therapeutics](https://www.modernatx.com) (July 2021).
Prior to that, I was part of a special ops data team
at [the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research's Informatics department](https://www.nibr.com/) (Sep 2017).
Prior to that, I was an [Insight Health Data Sciences Fellow](http://insighthealthdata.com/),
and defended my [doctoral thesis](http://ericmjl.github.io/thesis)
in the [Department of Biological Engineering](https://be.mit.edu/)
at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) earlier in 2017.

My life's motto is quoted from the Gospel of Luke:

> From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded;
> and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.
>
> <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/LUK.12.48">Luke 12:48</a>

I am an [open source](./open-source) contributor and developer,
a [speaker](./talks) and [educator](./teaching) at Python conferences.
My professional mission is to make science run at the speed of thought
so that we can discover new medicines for patients faster.

Professionally,
I am on the [Editorial Review Board](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/editorial-board-reviewers.html)
of the [Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu),
and have served on the organizing committees for PyCon and SciPy conferences
as part of the conferences' respective Financial Aid teams.
