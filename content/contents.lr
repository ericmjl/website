Hi! I'm Eric, and I am part of [Novartis'](https://www.nibr.com/) Scientific Data Analysis team (Sep 2017). Prior to that, I was an [Insight Health Data Sciences Fellow](http://insighthealthdata.com/), and defended my [doctoral thesis](http://ericmjl.github.io/thesis) in the [Department of Biological Engineering](https://be.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) earlier in 2017.

My life's motto is quoted from the Gospel of Luke: *"... From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked." - [Luke 12:48](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/LUK.12.48)*

I am an [open source](./open-source) contributor and developer, a [speaker](./talks) and [educator](./teaching) at Python conferences, and take a particular interest in melding data science with molecular biology to build new cures for patients.

I'd love to [connect with you](http://www.shortwhale.com/ericmjl). If you'd like to schedule a coffee chat with me, [Doodle](https://beta.doodle.com/ericmjl) is the best way. Other ways to connect are linked at the bottom of the page as well.

If you're curious, this website was hand-crafted using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/).
