I just learned about a neat trick when using `pytest` - the ability to "mark" tests with metadata, and the ability to selectively run groups of marked tests.

Here's an example:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.slow  # annotate it as a "slow" test
def test_that_runs_slowly():
    ....

@pytest.mark.slow  # annotate test as a "slow" test.
@pytest.mark.integration  # annotate test as being an "integration" test
def test_that_does_integration():
    ....
```

What's really cool here is that I can selectively run slow tests or selectively run integration tests:

```bash
$ py.test -m "slow"   # only runs "slow" tests
$ py.test -m "integration"  # only runs "integration" tests
$ py.test -m "not integration"  # only runs tests that are not "integration" tests.
```

summary: In this blog post, let me share with you how we can selectively run a test using `pytest`'s machinery.
