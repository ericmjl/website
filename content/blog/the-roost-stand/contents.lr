title: The Roost Stand

body:

A while ago, I backed the Roost Stand on Kickstarter. Of all the things I’ve backed so far, I think the Roost Stand is the only one that I’d consider an investment.

It’s saved my neck from countless hours of pain, especially when working from home.

It's a daily feature of my workstation.

It’s turned coffee shop tables into workstations.

Taking it around is really portable as well!

Can’t wait to see what the Roost makers have up their sleeves next!
