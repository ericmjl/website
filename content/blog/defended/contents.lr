body:

It is done! I have defended my doctoral thesis, supervised by Prof. Jonathan A. Runstadler, advised by Prof. Mark Bathe and Prof. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, conducted as a student in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT.

Looking back, it's been an amazingly fun journey, and I'll be updating this space with a more detailed account of the thesis defence process. Stay tuned!
