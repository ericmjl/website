title: Easy `matplotlib` animations

Recently, [`celluloid`][celluloid]caught my eye: it's a package that lets you create `matplotlib` animations easily!

If you need a dead-simple example to convince you to check it out, here's one lifted straight from the repository:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from celluloid import Camera

fig = plt.figure()
camera = Camera(fig)
for i in range(10):
    plt.plot([i] * 10)
    camera.snap()
animation = camera.animate()
```

But seriously though, if you use the workhorse Python drawing package `matplotlib` for anything,
this package can be considered to be one of those "great tricks to have" in your bag!
