title: Graphs and Matrices

Once again, Iâ€™m reminded through my research
how neat and useful it is to be able to think of matrices as graphs and vice-versa.

I was constructing a symmetric square matrix of values,
in which multiple cells of the matrix were empty (i.e. no values present).
(Thankfully, the diagonal is guaranteed dense.)
From this matrix, I wanted the largest set of rows/columns that formed a symmetric,
densely populated square matrix of values,
subject to a second constraint that the set of rows/columns
also maximally intersected with another set of items.

Having thought about the requirements of the problem,
my prior experience with graphs reminded me that
every graph has a corresponding adjacency matrix,
and that finding the densest symmetric subset of entries in the matrix
was equivalent to finding cliques in a graph!
My intern and I proceeded to convert the matrix into its graph representation,
and a few API calls in `networkx` later, we found the matrix we needed.

The key takeaway from this experience?
Finding the right representation for a problem,
we can computationally solve them quickly by using the appropriate APIs!

summary: The connection between graphs and linear algebra is profound and deep. I learned that lesson yet again. Come read more about it!
