I finally learned how to build and serve apps with Panel! 

Here are the key ideas:

1. Prototype the app inside a Jupyter notebook. That gives the real-time feedback on whether your apps/widgets are working or not. 
2. The most important thing is that the final thing you package together is now a `.servable()` object.
2. Use Panel’s `serve` command to test the app locally. It’s actually quite magical - the serve command can actually parse a Jupyter notebook and serve it up on a local web server.
3. When you’ve confirmed that everything is working properly locally, Heroku is a great deployment option. Using the default Python buildpack and a `requirements.txt` file, one can easily specify the exact Python environment for deployment.

As a pedagogical implementation, I put up a [minimal panel app on GitHub](https://github.com/ericmjl/minimal-panel-app), and also [served it up on Heroku](https://minimal-panel.herokuapp.com). Come check it out! I hope it’s useful for you.
