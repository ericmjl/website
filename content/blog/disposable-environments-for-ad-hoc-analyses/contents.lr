title: Disposable environments for ad-hoc analyses

body:

I recently learned about `juv`,
a package by my SciPy friend Trevor Manz.
It builds upon `uv`,
which, alongside `pixi`,
are the hottest things in Python (and more broadly, Data Science) tooling
since `pip` officially replaced `easy_install`
as the _de facto_ way to install Python packages.
`uv` supports [PEP723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/),
which is a Python enhancement proposal (PEP) that

> specifies a metadata format
> that can be embedded in single-file Python scripts
> to assist launchers, IDEs and other external tools
> which may need to interact with such scripts.

Made more concretely for the purposes of this post,
this enables us to specify the Python version
that is supposed to be used to execute a script,
and, more importantly,
the dependencies that are needed!

It basically looks like this,
as the first cell in your notebook,
say, `notebook.ipynb`

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.10"
# dependencies = [
#     "pandas==2.0",
#     "numpy>=2.0",
#     "matplotlib==3.1",
#     "scikit-learn",
#     ...
# ]
# ///
```

The following cells are the notebook code that you write in a normal fashion.

One can then use `juv` to run a notebook server with that auto-created Python environment:

```bash
juv run notebook.ipynb
```

And `juv` will auto-install the dependencies:

```bash
❯ juv run notebook.ipynb
Reading inline script metadata from `stdin`
   Built minikanren==1.0.3
   Built etuples==0.3.9
   Built cons==0.4.6
   Built logical-unification==0.4.6
Installed 60 packages in 329ms
```
You'll get this notebook server,
in which you can run the code,
just like in regular JupyterLab.

![Jupyter session launched by `juv`.](./juv-launched-jupyter.webp)

Compared to writing out a full `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `environment.yml` file,
this reduces the burden of distributing code + environments to a single file,
your notebook.
In terms of mental overload,
for an ad-hoc analysis conducted within a single notebook,
this is much better than needing to work within, say,
a `scratch` environment that is maintained to support multiple notebooks.
In [the words of the `marimo` folks](https://marimo.io/blog/sandboxed-notebooks):

> **In other words, marimo makes it possible to create and share standalone notebooks,
> without shipping `requirements.txt` files alongside them**.
> This provides two key benefits:
>
> 1. Notebooks that carry their own dependencies are easy to share —
>    just send the `.py` file!
> 2. Isolating a notebook from other installed packages prevents obscure bugs
>    arising from environment pollution,
>    while also hardening reproducibility.

To paraphrase `juv`'s [README](https://github.com/manzt/juv)
(which is accurate as of 5 Nov 2024),
this is the equivalent of having a fully-specified but also disposable environment,
in which the notebook itself specifies its own environment.

(I'll note that the `marimo` notebook also supports PEP723 as well!)
## Incorporating this into pyds-cli

As a prototype of how this would work within company-internal tooling, I wrapped `juv` inside `pyds-cli` as part of a new `pyds analysis init` and `pyds analysis run` set of commands.

`pyds analysis init` does what my friend Logan Thomas gave as early feedback for `pyds-cli`'s when I put together an initial project structure scaffold -- he wanted to see a "minimal initialization". Until PEP723 became a reality, I didn't have a good story for that. Now we do! To use `pyds-cli` to initialize a repo that contains only ad-hoc notebooks, we do:

```bash
pipx upgrade pyds-cli # upgrade pyds-cli using pipx, or else do `pip install -U pyds-cli`
pyds analysis init
```

This will trigger a form that asks you for some information:

```bash
/tmp via 🅒 pyds-cli on ☁️
❯ pyds analysis init
  [1/5] project_name (Name of the Project): dummy
  [2/5] short_description (A short description of the project): a test project
  [3/5] github_username (Your GitHub username): ericmjl
  [4/5] full_name (Your full name): Eric Ma
  [5/5] email (Your email address): e@ma
🎉Your analysis project has been created!
Run 'pyds analysis add <package>' to add dependencies to your notebook
Run 'pyds analysis run' to start working on your analysis
```

With the `project_name` being the name of the folder,
you can see that it is initialized with a `notebooks/` directory
and a `pyproject.toml`

```bash
/tmp via 🅒 pyds-cli on ☁️
❯ cd dummy
(pyds-cli)
dummy on  main is 📦 v0.0.1 via 🐍 v3.13.0 via 🅒 pyds-cli on ☁️  ericmajinglong@gmail.com
❯ ls

.rw-r--r--   325 ericmjl wheel  5 Nov 08:09   -- README.md
```

`pyproject.toml` contains a section for configuring `pyds-cli`
with _default packages_
that should be specified in every new notebook
created using `pyds analysis` commands:

```bash
dummy on  main is 📦 v0.0.1 via 🐍 v3.13.0 via 🅒 pyds-cli on ☁️
❯ cat pyproject.toml
───────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       │ File: pyproject.toml
       │ Size: 311 B
───────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1   │ [project]
   2   │ name = "dummy"
   3   │ version = "0.0.1"
   4   │ dependencies = [
   5   │     "juv",
   6   │ ]
   7   │ readme = "README.md"
   8   │
   9   │ # Default packages and python versions for new notebooks.
  10   │ [tool.pyds-cli]
  11   │ default_packages = [
  12   │     "pandas",
  13   │     "polars",
  14   │     "matplotlib",
  15   │     "numpy",
  16   │     "seaborn",
  17   │     "scikit-learn"
  18   │ ]
  19   │ python_version = ">=3.10"
───────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Using `pyds analysis`,
we can use the `create` command,
which basically creates a new notebook in the `notebooks/` directory
with the name that you specify,
and additional packages
on top of the default packages:

```bash
dummy on  main is 📦 v0.0.1 via 🐍 v3.13.0 via 🅒 pyds-cli on ☁️  ericmajinglong@gmail.com
❯ pyds analysis create --help

 Usage: pyds analysis create [OPTIONS] NAME

 Create a new notebook in the notebooks directory with default dependencies.
╭─ Arguments ──────────────-----------──────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ *    name      TEXT  Name of the notebook to create [default: None] [required]│
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
╭─ Options ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ --package  -p      TEXT  Additional packages to include [default: None]       │
│ --help                   Show this message and exit.                          │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Actually running it as an example:

```bash
dummy on  main is 📦 v0.0.1 via 🐍 v3.13.0 via 🅒 pyds-cli on ☁️  ericmajinglong@gmail.com
❯ pyds analysis create test.ipynb -p numba -p pymc -p arviz
Created notebook test.ipynb in notebooks directory
Added 9 default packages
Run 'pyds analysis run --notebook notebooks/test.ipynb' to start working
```

We get a new notebook that I can preview:

```bash
dummy on  main [?] is 📦 v0.0.1 via 🐍 v3.13.0 via 🅒 pyds-cli on ☁️  ericmajinglong@gmail.com
❯ cat notebooks/test.ipynb

───────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

As you can see,
we have the default packages
but also `pymc`, `arviz`, and `numba` installed.
Underneath the hood,
`juv` is doing most of the magic of adding dependencies,
but `pyds-cli` simply composes in the ability to read from `pyproject.toml`.
In a world where company-specific tooling were built,
such tooling might also include [automatically configuring keyrings for authentication on every call](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2024/9/19/how-to-set-up-pixi-with-codeartifacts/).

All in all,
I very much like the idea of _configurable and disposable_ (but nonetheless configurable) environments.
`juv` helps support this idea!
It essentially takes what `uv` would do
and apply it to Jupyter notebooks,
auto-creating the necessary kernel behind-the-scenes.
My wrapping of `juv` within `pyds-cli`
merely has to add in opinionated configuration;
the rest of it is a near one-to-one mapping.
I like where the Python tooling ecosystem is headed,
the future is exciting!

summary: In this blog post,
I explore the innovative 'juv' package,
which simplifies Python environment management for Jupyter notebooks
by embedding dependencies directly within the notebook file.
This approach eliminates the need for separate environment files,
making notebooks easily shareable
and reducing setup complexity.
I also discuss integrating 'juv' with 'pyds-cli'
to streamline ad-hoc data analyses within organizations,
enhancing reproducibility
and reducing environment conflicts.
Curious about how this could change your data science workflow?
