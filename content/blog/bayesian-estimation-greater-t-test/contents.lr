title: Bayesian Estimation > t-Test

Recently found a very good article on the ArXiv about Bayesian estimation for difference in sample means. Loved the fact that someone's done the work so that I don't have to!

The paper essentially explores how a Bayesian estimation (BEST) is essentially much, much better than traditional Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), and the author provides a good number of convincing arguments for this. The author basically covers the most commonly-used case in the experimental sciences - inter-comparison between an experimental and control group. I'd recommend reading it; here's a link to the paper: http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2013JEPG.pdf

While skimming through it, I then found a PyMC3 recipe, as usual, provided by the awesome [Thomas Wiecki](http://twiecki.github.io/) and Chris Fonnesbeck (http://stronginference.com/). https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/BEST.html

It makes me wonder... given how Bayesian inference is much more natural than Frequentist inference, why isn't this used more often?
