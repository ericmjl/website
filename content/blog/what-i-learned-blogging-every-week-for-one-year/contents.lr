title: What I learned blogging every week for one year
---
author: Eric J. Ma

body:

A challenge I set for myself this year
was to write a blog post on average once every week for the year,
regardless of what's going on.
This meant writing 52 blog posts in total.
As of December 19, I've hit 53, meaning that I've accomplished my goals!

## What I learned

Here's what I've learned so far.

### Consistency is king!

One of the biggest lessons I learned from this year-long blogging journey
is that consistency truly is king.
By committing to writing weekly,
I noticed my sense of what to write about
became increasingly refined and sharpened over time.
The regular practice helped me:

- Develop a better radar for interesting technical topics worth sharing
- Improve my ability to explain complex concepts clearly
- Build a more systematic approach to documenting my learning journey
- Create a sustainable writing habit that feels natural rather than forced

### Build AI-assistance tools and use them

Throughout this journey,
I found myself building quite a bit of tooling
to support my blogging workflow,
most of it done with AI assistance.
Some notable examples include:

**Blog Banner Generation**:
I developed a system that uses DALL-E
to automatically generate watercolor-style banner images for each post,
maintaining a consistent visual identity
while saving time on design.

**Social Media Integration**:
I built tools that use LLMs to help craft:

- Twitter posts that effectively summarize and promote new blog entries
- Substack newsletters that engage my subscriber base
- LinkedIn updates that resonate with my professional network

**Content Enhancement**:
I created automated systems for:

- Generating relevant tags for better post categorization
- Creating compelling summaries that capture the essence of each post
- Suggesting related content links to improve site navigation

This tooling journey has been particularly valuable as it helped me:

- Further hone my prompting practices with LLMs
- Develop better intuition for designing programs
  that incorporate LLMs as integral components
- Create a more efficient and consistent blogging workflow
- Experiment with different approaches to human-AI collaboration

The experience of building these tools
has not only made my blogging more efficient
but has also sharpened my intuition for
how to effectively integrate AI into creative workflows
while maintaining human oversight and editorial control.

## Wordcloud

And here is the obligatory wordcloud of the blog posts:

## Reflections

One year of blogging once a week,
with regular posts on LinkedIn, Twitter, Substack, and Bluesky,
have left my colleagues jokingly calling me a content creator.
Jokes aside, this year has seen a significant focus on LLMs in my writing,
as evidenced by the numerous posts in the LLMs & Data Science Tooling section.
This reflects the broader excitement and rapid developments in the LLM space.
At the same time,
my core interests continue to lie at the intersection of life sciences and computation -
you can see this in the many posts about protein language models,
biological applications of deep learning,
and data science in biotech organizations.
My professional goal is to make discovery science run at the speed of thought
and quantify the unquantified.
This means leveraging advances in AI and computation
to accelerate scientific discovery,
while developing tools that help scientists
measure and understand previously intangible aspects of biology.
After all, the most transformative breakthroughs happen
when we remove the friction from scientific exploration
and shine light on unexplored territory.

## Blog Posts by Theme

To help you navigate through these posts more easily,
I've organized them by major themes below.
You'll notice some posts appear under multiple themes -
that's because many topics naturally overlap,
reflecting the interconnected nature of modern data science work.
Whether you're interested in LLMs, leadership, tooling, or biology,
you'll find relevant content in these curated lists.

summary: In this blog post, I reflect on my year-long challenge of writing a blog post every week, surpassing my goal with 53 posts. This journey taught me the power of consistency, improved my ability to communicate complex ideas, and helped me develop AI-assisted tools to streamline my workflow. I also explored the intersection of life sciences and computation, aiming to accelerate scientific discovery. How did these experiences shape my approach to integrating AI into creative processes and what insights can you gain from my journey?
