title: nano text editor hacks

Much as I've embraced the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/), there are times when the GUI isn't accessible to us, and we are forced to use a Terminal-based text editor.

Now, I'm not one of those crazy types who use emacs or vim - those are the real seasoned pros. (I still don't know how to exit vim, btw.) As such, my terminal editor of choice remains the venerable `nano`. Here's some hacks that I recently figured out, to make text editing much easier in `nano`. 

**(1) Syntax highlighting**

This is such a big one! Syntax highlighting seriously helps a ton. If you're on a Mac, make sure you install `homebrew`'s version of `nano` - you can look at my [dotfiles][dotfilesL41] or run the command:

```
$ brew install nano
```

Then, edit your `~/.nanorc` file to look something like this:

```
include /usr/local/share/nano/python.nanorc  # gives you Python syntax highlighting
include /usr/local/share/nano/sh.nanorc  # gives you bash shell syntax highlighting
```

Next time you use `nano` (from your user account), syntax highlighting should be enabled!

You can find a sample [.nanorc] file on my GitHub [dotfiles] repository

**(2) Keyboard Shortcuts**

Here's a laundry list of keyboard shortcuts I've muscle-memorized:

* `Ctrl-x`: quits. There will be a prompt to save the file if it's been modified.
    * I usually end up doing `Ctrl-x-y-Enter`.
* `Ctrl-v` scrolls down a page
* `Ctrl-y` scrolls up a page
* `Ctrl-w` searches the document for a term that you type in (think "where")
* `Ctrl-k` cuts the line
* `Ctrl-u` pastes a cut line
* `Ctrl-^` (i.e. `Ctrl-Shift-6` on macOS keyboards) starts a "select" cursor.
    * You can use arrow keys to expand or shrink the selection, which can then be cut and pasted.
* `Ctrl-c` cancels any commands that are 'active'.
* `Ctrl-o` activates the "save file" dialogue - lets you save your state without quitting.

**(3) Persistence**

`nano`, being not as fancy as `vim` or `emacs`, means it doesn't have the concept of sessions. Doesn't matter - use [`tmux`] to persist!

All-in-all, the biggest one that aids in writing on a terminal editor is syntax highlighting. I wrote this blog post in `nano`, and being able to visually see different parts of my text highlighted according to their meaning has made writing much easier.
