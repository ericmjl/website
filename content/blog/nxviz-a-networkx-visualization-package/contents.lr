body:

I have been developing network visualization implementations for Python, mostly because I needed them. I also believe in open source principles, that broadly useful and applicable code should be made freely available with their implementations made transparent. Based on these principles, I have released Python implementations of [circos](https://github.com/ericmjl/Circos) and [hive plots](https://github.com/ericmjl/hiveplot), with a ton of help from [Justin Zabilansky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-zabilansky-95390b3b) (MIT, now AeroFarms) and [Jon Charest](http://jonchar.net) (MGH, who, by the way, is an aspiring data scientist).

At [SciPy 2016](http://scipy2016.scipy.org), I had the opportunity to chat with our conference co-chair, [Aric Hagberg](http://aric.hagberg.org), who also happens to be the lead maintainer of the [NetworkX package](https://networkx.github.io). Specifically, I asked about contributing circos and hive plots into NetworkX. From our discussion, and from discussing with Jon, we have this idea to create an [`nxviz`](https://github.com/ericmjl/nxviz) package that provides a consistent API for creating network visualizations. Really excited about this! I also roped in a brilliant 1st-year UW undergrad [Nelson Liu](http://nelsonliu.me/index.html), who also has some network visualizations that he’d like to implement for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). (No pressure, of course!)

Looking forward to developing this "rational" network visualization package!
