A new version of nxviz is released!

In this update, I have added a declarative interface for visualizing geographically-constrained graphs. Here, nodes in a graph have their placement constrained by longitude and latitude.

An example of how to use it is below:

[![nxviz geoplots](./carbon-small.png)](./carbon-original.png)

In the GeoPlot constructor API, the keyword arguments `node_lat` and `node_lon` specify which node metadata are to be used to place nodes on the x- and y- axes.

By no means do I intend for GeoPlot to replace more sophisticated analysis methods; like `seaborn`, the interface is declarative; for me, the intent is to provide a very quick-and-dirty way for an end user to visualize graphs with spatially constrained nodes.

Please enjoy!
