Today, I learned that one of Canada's exports is actually _education_.

It sounds weird, but I learned this from Economics Explained, and I think I can follow the logic.

A foreign student who studies in Canada brings money into the country.
Four years later (or longer), Canada sends that student back to their home country.
Canada's economy gets money, while the foreign country gets a smarter student.

Economists have a very different way of looking at the world.
