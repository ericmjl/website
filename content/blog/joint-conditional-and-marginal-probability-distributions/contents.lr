title: Joint, conditional, and marginal probability distributions

body:

Joint probability, conditional probability, and marginal probability... These are three central terms when learning about probability, and they show up in Bayesian statistics as well. However... I never really could remember what they were, especially since we were usually taught them using formulas, rather than pictures.

Well, for those who learn a bit better using pictures... if you know what a probability distribution is, then hopefully these help with remembering what these terms mean. (Clicking on the image will bring you to the original, hosted on GitHub.)
