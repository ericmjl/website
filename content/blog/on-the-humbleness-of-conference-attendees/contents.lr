title: On the 'humbleness' of conference attendees

Conferences are made up of people, just like any other group of human beings grouping together.

What makes one differ from another really boils down to the people.

I read a tweet recently that described the SciPy 2015 conference as having really 'humble' attendees. This was exactly my feeling! It was great to see such a community of developers and scientists who, knowing that while they may be domain experts there is still much to learn, choose to carry themselves in a really humble way.

I think this was one of the reasons why I really enjoyed SciPy. It was devoid of the ego that plagues other field-specific conferences. Yet another reason to go again!
