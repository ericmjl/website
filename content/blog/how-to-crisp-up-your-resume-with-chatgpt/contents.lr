Today I figured out a way to use ChatGPT (and GPT4, by extension) to crisp up a PhD student's resume.

The prompt looks like this:

> Help me reduce this bullet point to:
>
> "Used (method X) to solve (problem Y) with (impact z)"
>
> (then put your bullet point here)

The way this works is as follows: Firstly, GPT will give you a proposed rephrasing. If it's not short enough, you can ask GPT:

> Can you shorten it further?

Then, you then interactively work with ChatGPT to wordsmith your bullet point until it's as short as it can possibly be (without loss of information). Obviously, the human needs to judge whether it's "without loss of information"!
