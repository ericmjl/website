body: I have found that I most successfully focus when I have my scribble book by my side. Jotting down what I'm going to do next on the notebook focuses my mind more than jotting it down in Evernote, which is done digitally. I think it's the combination of having it recorded on a companion "screen" to my MacBook Air.
