title: How to configure a minimum Python version in pyproject.toml

body:

Today, I learned how to set the minimum version of Python in `pyproject.toml`.

If I want a minimum version of Python:

```text
[project]
python = ">=3.10"
```

If I want a maximum version of Python:

```text
[project]
python = "<=3.10"
```

This problem came up within the context of `llamabot`, where I was using relatively new syntax to indicate the union of types:

```python
doc_paths: List[str] | List[Path] | str | Path = None
```

Pre-Python 3.10, the only way to show this was:

```python
doc_paths: Union[List[str], List[Path], str, Path] = None
```

Visually, I think the post-Python 3.10 syntax is a bit easier to reason about.

h/t my colleague Jiayi Cox who helped me identify the bug in [this issue](https://github.com/ericmjl/llamabot/issues/3).

summary:

In today's blog post, we dive into setting the minimum and maximum Python versions in `pyproject.toml` 🐍.
We explore how this impacts `llamabot` and discuss the new syntax for indicating the union of types in Python 3.10.
This new syntax is visually easier to understand, making our coding journey a bit smoother! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻
