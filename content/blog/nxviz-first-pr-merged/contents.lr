With thanks to [@KassnerNora](https://twitter.com/KassnerNora), `nxviz` has a new feature! Now, it is possible to specify edge colours. Previously, this was available in the API but was not working as I had not the time to implement it. 

Now, with [Nora's PR](https://github.com/ericmjl/nxviz/pull/260) merged in, users can declare their edges to be coloured by some edge metadata key! In addition to that, Nora included a `seaborn` colour palette that may be useful for drawing other edge colours. The API remains a declarative API, giving users an easy way to specify how they want rational graph plots to be made.

Thank you for the contribution, Nora!
