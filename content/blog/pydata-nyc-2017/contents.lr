I'm seriously looking forward to PyData NYC this year -- there's a great lineup of talks that I'm particularly looking forward to hearing! The theme for my set of must-see talks this year is "Bayesian machine learning" - there's much for me to learn!

The first is by my fellow Boston Bayesian **[Colin Caroll](https://colindcarroll.com/)** with his talk titled [Two views on regression with PyMC3 and scikit-learn](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/12/). Colin is a mathematician at heart, even though he does software engineering for living now, and I can't wait to hear about regularization strategies!

The second is by **[Nicole Carlson](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/speaker/profile/6/)**, with her talk titled [Turning PyMC3 into scikit-learn](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/24/). Nicole's talk is of interest to me because I've implemented models in PyMC3 before, and now would like to know how to make them reusable!

The third talk is by **[Chaya Stern](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/speaker/profile/118/)**, with her talk titled [Bayesian inference in computational chemistry](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/53/). Super relevant to my work at Novartis!

The fourth is by my fellow Boston Pythonista **[Joe Jevnik](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/speaker/profile/34/)**, who will be speaking on the first day about his journey into deep learning on some really cool time-series data. He works at Quantopian, BUT the spoiler here is that his talk is NOT about financial data! (I've heard his talk outline already.)

The fifth is a tutorial by **[Jacob Schrieber](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/speaker/profile/29/)**, with his talk titled [pomegranate: fast and flexible probabilistic modeling in python](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/30/). `pomegranate`'s API models after the `scikit-learn`'s API; with the API being the user-facing interface, and `scikit-learn` being the *de facto* go-to library for machine learning, I'd be interested to see how much more `pomegranate` adds to the ecosystem, particularly w.r.t. Bayesian models.

There are a swathe of other good talks that I'm expecting to be able to catch online later on. **[Matt Rocklin](https://matthewrocklin.com/)**, who is the lead developer of Dask, has done a ton of work on speeding Python up through parallelism. His talk will be on [the use of Cython & Dask to speed up GeoPandas](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/22/).

Also, **[Thomas Caswell](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/speaker/profile/80/)**, one of the [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/) lead devs who helped guide my first foray into open source contributions, is giving a tutorial on [developing interactive figures in matplotlib](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/3/). Highly recommended if you're into the visualization world!

Finally, the always-interesting, always entertaining **[en zyme](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/25/)** will be speaking on an [interesting topic](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/25/).

Looking forward to being at the conference, and meeting old and new friends there!
