Following my [previous blog post on how to make pre-commit hooks](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2023/10/14/how-i-made-a-local-pre-commit-hook-to-resize-images/), I finally made my first *distributable* pre-commit hook that is installable by the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) framework! The pre-commit hook is called `convert-to-webp`, and is housed in the repo [`ericmjl/webp-pre-commit`](https://github.com/ericmjl/webp-pre-commit).

Pre-commit hooks are fantastic! They enable us to run automatic checks on files to be committed into a repository before they are committed. This allows us to automatically ensure that, for example, large files are not committed into the repository or, in the case of `convert-to-webp`, images are converted to the highly optimized `.webp` format before being committed.

Having just learned how to make a distributable pre-commit hook, I am documenting how it works here for future reference.

## Essential configuration files in the source repository

The most important configuration file we need within the repository is called `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`. This defines what hooks are available from within the repository. In my case, I have only one defined, `convert-to-webp`, and it is configured as follows:

```yaml
- id: convert-to-webp
  name: Convert images to WebP
  description: This hook converts image files to WebP format.
  entry: webp-hook
  language: python
  files: \.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|tiff)$
  additional_dependencies:
    - Pillow
    - typer
```

Let's explain what each line is:

- `id`: This is the name identifier of the pre-commit hook to run.
- `name`: This is the display name of the hook when it is run at the terminal.
- `description`: Something human-readable.
- `entry`: This is the command that gets run. All relevant files are added as arguments automatically, so in this case, it'll be `$ webp-hook file1.png file2.tiff file3.bmp` etc.
- `language`: This is the programming language that it's written in.
- `files`: A regex pattern for the kind of file extensions that will be subject to checks by this hook.
- `additional_dependencies`: An array of dependencies necessary to run the hook. In this case, I have a list of package dependencies.

A few questions may be lingering here: what is this `webp-hook` command that I wrote?

It turns out to be a Typer CLI! This is implemented within the `webp_hook` directory:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x     - ericmjl  7 Apr 23:56   -- ├── webp_hook
.rw-r--r--   922 ericmjl  8 Apr 08:38   -- │  └── cli.py
```

To ensure that the CLI gets run as a command entry point at the command line, we configure this in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.scripts]
webp-hook = "webp_hook.cli:app"
```

Because there's only one command in `cli.py` (defined under the `convert` function) I can get away with using `webp-hook` as the command to run rather than `webp-hook convert` as the command.

Another crucial thing is to have tagged versions of the repository. To ensure this is done efficiently, I use `bumpversion` (but should upgrade to `bump-my-version` soon) when cutting a new tagged release. This tagged version is referenced in my individual project repo's configuration files.

## Obtaining the pre-commit hook

To obtain the pre-commit hook, all we need to do is add the following line into the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (not to be confused with the `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`) file:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/ericmjl/webp-pre-commit # <-- URL to repository
  rev: v0.0.8 # <-- this is the tagged version
  hooks:
  - id: convert-to-webp # <-- this is the `id` defined above
```

Now, the `pre-commit` framework will automatically manage the installation of the pre-commit hook within its own virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the command `webp-hook` upon committing new files. The output should look like this:

```bash
❯ git commit
check yaml...........................................(no files to check)Skipped
fix end of files.....................................(no files to check)Skipped
trim trailing whitespace.............................(no files to check)Skipped
Convert images to WebP...............................(no files to check)Skipped
# notice the name of the pre-commit hook above!
```

## Summary of steps

Let's recap how do we create a pre-commit hook that can be distributed to others. The key steps, in order, are:

1. Create a new repository in which you develop an installable and distributable command-line tool.
2. In that repository, ensure that you have a `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` configuration file that declares that the pre-commit hook is.
3. Use `bump-my-version` (or manual git tagging) to cut new tagged releases of your pre-commit hook.
4. In a different project repository, add the hook to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

As you develop the hook, continue cutting new releases through `git` tags. When you cut new releases, go to your downstream project code and ask `pre-commit` to update the hooks by running `pre-commit autoupdate`.

## For teams...

Now that you know how to build your own pre-commit hooks, you can be empowered to create custom checks for your code that hold it to your company's own internal standards! I can also imagine many creative uses, including the use of LLM APIs within the pre-commit hooks that get run that parse code for issues that are difficult to detect using programmatic rules, not unlike [writing commit messages based on git diffs](https://ericmjl.github.io/llamabot/cli/git/)!

Happy code checking!

summary: In this blog post, I share my journey of creating my first distributable pre-commit hook, `convert-to-webp`, using the pre-commit framework. This hook automatically converts images to the `.webp` format before they're committed to a repository, ensuring optimized image storage. I detail the essential configuration files, the creation of a Typer CLI for the hook, and how to make the hook available for others by tagging versions and adding it to a project's .pre-commit-config.yaml file. Curious about how to streamline your codebase with automated checks? How might this improve your project's efficiency?
