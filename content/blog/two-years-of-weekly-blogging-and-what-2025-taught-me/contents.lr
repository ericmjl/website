title: Two years of weekly blogging and what 2025 taught me
---
author: Eric J. Ma

body:

Last year, I challenged myself to write one blog post per week,
and I hit 53 posts by the end of 2024.
This year, I doubled down on that commitment
and wrote 50 posts in 2025.
Including this one, it's 51,
bringing me to 104 blog posts over two years.

## The year of coding agents

Looking at my 2025 posts,
one theme dominates: **coding agents**.
I wrote extensively about how to work with AI coding assistants,
from teaching them with AGENTS.md files
to letting them work autonomously.
This reflected a shift in how I work day-to-day.

Some highlights from this theme:

- [How to teach your coding agent with AGENTS.md](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/10/4/how-to-teach-your-coding-agent-with-agentsmd/)
- [Safe ways to let your coding agent work autonomously](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/11/8/safe-ways-to-let-your-coding-agent-work-autonomously/)
- [Productive Patterns for Agent-Assisted Programming](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/12/10/productive-patterns-for-agent-assisted-programming/)
- [How I Replaced 307 Lines of Agent Code with 4 Lines](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/11/16/how-i-replaced-307-lines-of-agent-code-with-4-lines/)

The shift from "AI as a tool" to "AI as a collaborator"
captures how my practice evolved this year.
I've gone from cautiously experimenting with Cursor
to having established patterns for multi-repository agent workflows.

## Bayesian methods and biological applications

My work continued to inform my writing,
with several posts on applying Bayesian statistics to real lab problems.
The R2D2 prior posts were particularly satisfying to write
because I felt equipped with new theoretical knowledge that was directly applicable,
and I appreciated the mathematical aesthetics behind the approach:

- [Bayesian Superiority Estimation with R2D2 Priors: A Practical Guide for Protein Screening](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/4/3/bayesian-superiority-estimation-with-r2d2-priors-a-practical-guide-for-protein-screening/)
- [Stop guessing at priors: R2D2's automated approach to Bayesian modeling](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/8/6/stop-guessing-at-priors-r2d2s-automated-approach-to-bayesian-modeling/)
- [From data chaos to statistical clarity: A laboratory transformation story](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/4/5/from-data-chaos-to-statistical-clarity-a-laboratory-transformation-story/)

I also explored the challenges of working with lab data,
including why preclinical experiments make ML challenging
and how to communicate effectively with lab scientists.

## Tools I got excited about

Every year brings new tools that change how I work.
In 2025, two stood out.

[Marimo](https://marimo.io/) is a reactive notebook tool
that I wrote about with enthusiasm,
and followed up with practical guidance on using coding agents to write Marimo notebooks.
The reactive execution model aligns well with how I think about data exploration.

[Modal](https://modal.com/) is cloud computing that actually feels Pythonic.
My "Wow, Modal!" post captured the delight of finding infrastructure
that doesn't fight against my workflow.

## Data science leadership and career

I continued writing about the human side of data science work,
including standardizing ways of working, communicating with lab scientists,
and navigating the biotech industry's ups and downs.
The year ended with
[The selfish reason to do your best work](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/12/17/the-selfish-reason-to-do-your-best-work/),
which synthesized lessons from a challenging year in biotech.

## Looking ahead to 2026

After two years of writing almost weekly on whatever is on my mind,
I am adjusting my goals.
Next year, my attention shifts towards
(a) learning the fundamentals of quantum computing through an ultralearning project,
(b) writing more on data science leadership and career development to encourage colleagues navigating similar paths, and
(c) building out at least 10 experimental things with AI.
I am also dropping the goal of "one blog post per week" to four per month,
which brings me to a goal of 48 for 2026.
I am giving myself space to rest and strategically plan out writing going into 2026.

Merry Christmas and a happy new year to all my readers!

summary: Reflecting on my second year of weekly blogging, I published 50 posts in 2025, bringing my two-year total past 100. This year was dominated by coding agents and AI-assisted programming, with extensive writing on AGENTS.md, autonomous agents, and productive patterns for working with AI. I also explored Bayesian methods for biological applications, got excited about Marimo and Modal, and wrote about data science leadership and career development. Two years of consistent writing has reinforced that writing clarifies thinking, consistency compounds, and the best posts come from problems you're actively solving.
