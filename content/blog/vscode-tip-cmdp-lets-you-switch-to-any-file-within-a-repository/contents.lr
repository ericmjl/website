Sharing a quick tip here when using VSCode.

I have noticed colleagues sometimes struggle to locate
an exact file that they want to open when using VSCode.
As it turns out, the Command Palette gives us a quick way
of navigating to any file within a repository.

The trick here is to do a `Cmd+P`,
which will open up the command palette in file-browsing mode.
From there, you can start typing keywords
to quickly narrow down the exact file that you want to open.
Any portion of the file path is fair game!

It looks something like this (you can click on the image to zoom in):
