[Matt Johnson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/~mattjj/) (of [HIPS](http://hips.seas.harvard.edu)) had an interesting comment on Wednesday. 

LLVM's relationship to machine code is a bit like Deep Learning's relationship to Bayesian models. Deep learning abstracts out details into a reliable black box, unlike Bayesian models in which all details need to be known. Likewise, LLVM abstracts out machine code in a reliable fashion, so that higher level programming languages don't have to think about that stuff.

Interesting.
