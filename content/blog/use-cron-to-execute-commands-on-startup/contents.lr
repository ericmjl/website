title: Use Cron to execute commands on startup

body:

Today I learned how to execute arbitrary commands on startup on a Linux machine.

This trick uses `cron`, and is essentially adding something like this to your crontab:

```shell
@reboot /absolute/path/to/your/command with args
```

There are other ways of doing so as well, according to [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/run-a-script-on-startup-in-linux),
including using `rc.local`, `init.d`, and `systemd`.
While I'm quite sure there are good reasons for more than one way to accomplish this task,
I think using `cron` is pretty elegant for the following reasons:

1. The syntax is very clean.
2. `cron` is almost universally installed on Linux variants.
3. `cron` is a conceptually well-accepted place for automated execution of commands on a schedule.
