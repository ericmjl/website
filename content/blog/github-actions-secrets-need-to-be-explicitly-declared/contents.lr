title: GitHub Actions secrets need to be explicitly declared

Today, in releasing a new version of LlamaBot, I also made a change for one of the `SimpleBot`s that I wrote to use the Mistral AI models instead of GPT-4. That meant that I needed to use a Mistral API key as part of the environment variables. However, no matter what  I tried, I couldn't seem to get the environment variable set within my GitHub action, even though it was declared as an Actions Repository-level secret.

Turns out, declaring an Actions Repository secret doesn't immediately make it available to the GitHub Actions runner! According to the official documentation,

> GitHub Actions can only read a secret if you explicitly include the secret in a workflow.
>
> (Source: [GitHub Actions docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow))

This turns out to be a great security practice, even if it caused me no end of frustration for over 3 hours this evening. But how do we include it in a workflow step? It is done this way:

```python
    - step:
      - name: Write release notes
        ##### PAY ATTENTION HERE! #####
        env:
          MISTRAL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MISTRAL_API_KEY }}
        ##### PAY ATTENTION HERE! #####
        run: |
          python -m pip install -e .
          llamabot configure api-key --api-key="${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}"
          llamabot configure default-model --model-name="${{ secrets.DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_MODEL }}"
          llamabot git write-release-notes # <-- this line needs access to the MISTRAL_API_KEY environment variable!
```

summary: In this blog post, I share my experience of debugging GitHub Actions for LlamaBot. I encountered a challenge with setting the Mistral API key as an environment variable in my GitHub action. After hours of frustration, I discovered that GitHub Actions can only read a secret if it's explicitly included in a workflow. I explain how to include it in a workflow step. Curious about how to securely manage your API keys in GitHub Actions? Read on!
