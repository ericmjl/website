I am consolidating my Hive Plot and Circos Plot implementations into a single visualization package. Design goals include:

- A rational naming system (where not already existent) for each plot.
    - Hive Plots
    - Circos Plots
    - Panel Plots (with Horizontal/Vertical orientations)
    - Arc Plots
    - ...and more!
- A declarative API for each type of plot, the user to delcare:
    - Node positioning
    - Node size (area, radius)
    - Node colour
    - Edge colour
    - Edge linewidth

Contributors include [Jon][1], [Leo][2], and [Nelson][3] - very happy to be working with them!
