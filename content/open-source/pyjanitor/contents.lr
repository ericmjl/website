text: I developed `pyjanitor`, an open source port of the R package [janitor](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor), to bring friendly APIs to data cleaning tasks for data scientists. It features a sane API that wraps other tools (pandas, missingno, etc.) to help data scientists accomplish common data cleaning tasks.
