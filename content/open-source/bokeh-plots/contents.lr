description:

Continuing my desire to learn more about open source and to make contributions to data visualization libraries, I contributed an implementation of horizontal (`HBar`)and vertical (`VBar`) bar glyphs.

Many thanks for the help of Bryan Van de Ven and Sarah Bird, lead developers on Bokeh, who guided me through the code base line by line.
