description: I found a bug in PyMC3's multinomial random variate sampler, related to floating point precision issues while moving numbers from the GPU to the CPU, when working on my [Bayesian analysis recipes repository](https://github.com/ericmjl/bayesian-analysis-recipes). Specifically, we get probability values that sum to infinitesimally larger than one. I thus submitted a patch that fixed that converts the probabilities to `float64` precision and re-normalizes the probabilities to 1, before using them for random sampling.
