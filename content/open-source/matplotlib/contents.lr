I contributed to the [`matplotlib` enhancement proposal 12](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/1572a7e53ae255e7adda55b3a84d708b226edaa6/doc/devel/MEP/MEP12.rst), which proposed reorganizing the examples gallery to make it easier for `matplotlib` users to find relevant examples.

Part of the problem was that there were old `pylab` examples, but the new `pyplot` API was now preferred over the old `pylab` API (which was really present mostly to convert MATLAB users).  I helped fix all the `pylab` examples by changing

```python
from pylab import *
```

statements to explicit

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```
