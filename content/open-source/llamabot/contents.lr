I built LlamaBot to teach myself stuff about the world of LLMs. The product of that work is something I'm freely offering back to the world.

Meanwhile, it's got some pretty cool functionality in there that I've implemented as demonstrations of how to use it.

For example, one can chat with papers within your Zotero library. Also, you can use it to write commit messages for code diffs.

Do check it out!
