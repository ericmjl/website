text: After two PyCons and one SciPy conference, I became convinced of the need to apply software engineering principles to data analytics. One theme that I identified was the need for the practice of (semi-)automated data checks. After meeting with [Renee Chu](https://twitter.com/reneighbor) at PyCon 2016, we are collaborating on developing tutorial material to teach how to write data and unit tests.
