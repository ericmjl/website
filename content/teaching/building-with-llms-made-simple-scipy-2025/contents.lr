text: LLMs are everywhere, but building with them shouldn't feel like magic. In this hands-on session, I'll show you how to create robust, production-ready applications that actually work. We'll cover everything from prompt engineering that doesn't break to building systems that handle the messy reality of real-world AI applications. No hype, just practical code you can use tomorrow.
