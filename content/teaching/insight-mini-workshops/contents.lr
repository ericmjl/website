title: Insight Mini-Workshops
---
description:

As part of my time at Insight, I led mini-workshops on web development and Bokeh, Pythonic code style & code linting, and co-led mini-workshops on deep learning.

Here's a collection of repositories that were involved in teaching this:

- [Minimal Flask Example](https://github.com/ericmjl/minimal-flask-example)
- [Code Style](https://github.com/ericmjl/pycodestyle-tutorial)
