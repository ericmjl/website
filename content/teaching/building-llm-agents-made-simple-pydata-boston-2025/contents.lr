text: Learn to build practical LLM agents using LlamaBot and Marimo notebooks. This hands-on tutorial teaches the most important lesson in agent development: start with workflows, not technology.

We'll build a complete back-office automation system through three agents: a receipt processor that extracts data from PDFs, an invoice writer that generates documents, and a coordinator that orchestrates both. This demonstrates the fundamental pattern for agent systems—map your boring workflows first, build focused agents for specific tasks, then compose them so agents can use other agents as tools.

By the end, you'll understand how to identify workflows worth automating, build agents with decision-making loops, compose agents into larger systems, and integrate them into your own work. You'll leave with working code and confidence to automate repetitive tasks.

Prerequisites: Intermediate Python, familiarity with APIs, basic LLM understanding. Participants should have Ollama and models installed beforehand (setup instructions provided).

Materials: GitHub repository with Marimo notebooks. Setup uses Pixi for dependency management.
