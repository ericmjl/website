text: A 90-minute tutorial on building LLM agents with a focus on developing a mental framework for thinking about agents, rather than just learning specific tools. The tutorial covers structured generation using Pydantic models, demonstrates practical applications like OCR and receipt processing, and shows how to build agent workflows using tools and function calling. Everything runs in the cloud using Marimo notebooks (via molab), requiring no local installation. The tutorial emphasizes that the way you think about agents is more important than the specific tools you use, and demonstrates how to work with open-source models that can run on laptops with 16-64GB of RAM. Presented at PyData Boston 2025.
