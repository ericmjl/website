text: I had noticed a growing interest in the use of machine learning (ML) to answer tough biological questions at the Broad Institute. During graduate school, I had taught myself the practical aspects of ML through the `scikit-learn` API; I found it to be a great introductory path into machine learning. In collaboration with [Andres Colubri](http://www.sabetilab.org/andres-colubri/), [David Dao](http://daviddao.de) and [Jane Hung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jane-hung-14153b10) (Broad Institute), we put together a workshop for members of the Broad Community, with the materials freely available.
