#### description ####
text: In this talk, I use two examples to illustrate how testing can be better incorporated into a data scientist's workflow. At the same time, I also introduce two libraries, [Hypothesis](hypothesis.readthedocs.io) and [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/), which can help with testing code and data.
