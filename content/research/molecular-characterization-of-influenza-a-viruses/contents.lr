title: Molecular Characterization of Influenza A Viruses
---
description:

By doing experiments on isolated viruses, we can tell whether they are dangerous or not. I have contributed to the design and analysis of experiments that characterize the molecular biology of newly isolated and unusual viral isolates. My contributions include image quantification, handling and analysis of large amounts of sequence data, and statistical analyses.
