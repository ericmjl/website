title: Hive Plots in Python
---
description: [Hive plots](http://hiveplot.net) are a rational way of visualizing networks. Out of frustration at the lack of a Python implementation, I wrote my own version, built on top of `matplotlib`, with an API design to be compatible with `networkx`. This project also happens to be my first independent open source contribution, with growing interest in the project on GitHub.
