title: Network Analysis Made Simple
---
description: I taught myself graph theory in graduate school, as a paradigm/tool for analyzing influenza evolutionary trajectories (please see my [Research](/research) page for more info). Borrowing the theme of [Allen Downey's](http://www.allendowney.com/wp/) "X Made Simple" series, I have started my own Network Analysis Made Simple series of Jupyter notebooks, to share this knowledge freely with everybody.
