title: Circos Plots in Python
---
description: [Circos plots](http://www.circos.ca) are an aesthetically pleasing way of visualizing networks, in which nodes are ordered around the circumference of a circle, and edges are drawn using Bezier curves within the circle. Because of the lack of a Python implementation, I wrote one with [Justin Zabilansky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-zabilansky-95390b3b) and [Jon Charest](http://jonchar.net).
