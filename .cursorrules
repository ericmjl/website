For ad-hoc scripts, in-line script metadata can be used to provide Python versions.
In-line Script metadata looks like this:

# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "requests<3",
#   "rich",
# ]
# ///

I usually like to be at least 1 minor version behind the latest,
and the latest Python version as of 2024-12-19 is Python 3.13.
For any scripts that I ask you to make, make sure you also include the necessary dependencies.
